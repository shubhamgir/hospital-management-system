# 🏥 Hospital Patient Management System (C)

A console-based program written in **C** that simulates a basic hospital workflow for managing patients.  
It efficiently handles both **normal** and **emergency** patients using **Queue** and **Priority Queue** data structures.

---

## 🔧 Features
- Add, display, and attend patients based on priority and severity  
- Separate handling for **normal** and **emergency** queues  
- Automatic sorting of emergency patients by severity and age  
- Practical implementation of **FIFO** and **priority queue** logic  
- Simple text-based interface for easy interaction  

---

## 💡 Concepts Used
- Queues and Priority Queues  
- Sorting algorithms  
- Structures (`struct`) in C  
- Modular programming and function-based design
